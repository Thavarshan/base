Base is a basic skeleton of a typical PHP composer package. It comes in handy when you need to quickly develop a PHP package.

> **Requires [PHP 7.3.0+](https://php.net/releases/)**

âœ¨ Create the package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer create-project thavarshan/base --prefer-source PackageName
```

ðŸ§¹ Keep a modern codebase with **PHP CS Fixer**:
```bash
composer lint
```

âœ… Run unit tests using **PHPUnit**:
```bash
composer test:unit
```

ðŸš€ Run the entire test suite:
```bash
composer test
```
